                 Williams Entertainment, etc.

FROM:    Roger Sharpe

SUBJECT: LICENSED PROPERTIES UPDATE REPORT FOR 1996 AND THE    
                 FIRST SCHEDULING OF PROPERTIES/PROJECTS FOR 1997 AND    
                 BEYOND                         

What follows is the ongoing identification of major (and many not so ‘major’) film 
projects/books/etc. that either are coming to theatres, TV or book shelves soon or appear 
to be fertile subject matter for potential game application whether it be video, pinball, 
novelty amusement equipment or the vast range of home software platforms.

By no means is this listing complete. There are always sleepers and less ambitious 
undertakings that can surprise everyone.  However, the hope is that some of my personal 
pre-editing and judgement calling is as accurate as any forecasting can be. Properties that 
appear to have some potential for reason of recognizeability or scope (from the standpoint 
of marketing support and/or “franchise potential) are bolded because I deem them to be 
viable candidates for consideration. Also, possible trends can emerge as indicators of 
where entertainment may be going in the near future.
